When creating, reviewing, or improving UI/UX designs, follow the Pure SaaS design system:

1. Read SKILL.md in full. It defines the stance, universal execution behaviors, the 6 core workflows,
   the 8-state component matrix, semantic token architecture, and honest verification reporting.
2. Retrieve exact references for the task using `npx pure-saas ref "<component, framework, or topic>"`.
3. Universal Command: Use `/pure-saas [request]` as the default entry point.
4. Specialist Commands:
   - `/pure-saas design [request]`: Establish or update DESIGN.md.
   - `/pure-saas polish [request]`: Elevate typography tracking, surface lighting, micro-interactions.
   - `/pure-saas review [request]`: 5-dimension deterministic audit (A11y, Perf, Theming, Responsive, Integrity).
   - `/pure-saas reference [URL]`: Deconstruct reference site into 16-section DESIGN.md.
   - `/pure-saas responsive [request]`: Optimize across mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px).
   - `/pure-saas browser [action]`: Token-conscious browser automation & responsive screenshots via Playwright CLI.
   - `/pure-saas 3d [action]`: Procedural Three.js 3D model synthesis from reference images.
5. Non-Negotiable Engineering Rules:
   - Zero raw hex colors or arbitrary styling: resolve to semantic tokens in DESIGN.md.
   - Zero generic AI slop: no purple/cyan gradient text, excessive glassmorphism blur, or green pulsing dots.
   - Preserve 100% of backend APIs, authentication, and database schemas.
   - Continuous Verification: verify tokens, contrast, and layout with `pure-saas contrast`, `pure-saas audit`, and `pure-saas browser screenshot`.
